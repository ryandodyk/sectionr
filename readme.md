# SECTIONR
What was going to be just a CLI interface for selecting some structural sections but is now going to be something beautiful-er 

## MAIN GOALS
- BE USER FRIENDLY
- Write save files in a Human-readable format so that changes can be tracked with GIT
- Be able to calculate reaction forces to be used with design
- 
## SUB GOALS
- Make a graphic representation of a building's structural parts
- Calculate design sections based on calculated reactions

## FUTURE
- Use the files as the basis for a BIM software
